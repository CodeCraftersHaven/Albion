# Albion Guide

- This is NOT a Discord Bot Template. It is a FULL Bot!

- A Discord App to get information about The First Descendant game and basic in-game user data made by [Â© NEXON Korea Corp. & NEXON Games Co, LTD](https://www.nexon.com/main/en).

- This project has been built around the latest version of [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) (v14.15.3) and [@sern/handler](https://sern.dev) (v4.0.1). It is not meant for older versions.

- Want to use my favorite discord bot handler? Join our [Discord Server](https://sern.dev/discord) if you need help! I highly recommend reading the [docs](https://sern.dev/v4/reference/getting-started) to familiarize yourself with the handler before attempting this! We also always suggest that you have at least basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript languages before trying to code a bot or before asking us for help.

- For help regarding this particular bot, open an issue and ping me.

- Want to contribute to this project? Fork the project, make your changes, and open a Pull Request!
